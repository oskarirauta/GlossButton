GlossButton

Glossy buttons like inbuilt calculator app

This is for of work by Codepadawan (https://github.com/Codepadawan/GlossButton)
Original was outdated and resulted errors in modern Xcode - Also in current Xcode
it seems to be default to use Automatic Reference Counting [ARC] - So I fixed the
errors, changed deprecated references to supported ones and changed it to use ARC.
