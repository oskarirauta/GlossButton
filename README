GlossButton

Glossy buttons like inbuilt calculator app

This is for of work by Codepadawan (https://github.com/Codepadawan/GlossButton)
Original was outdated and resulted errors in modern Xcode - Also in current Xcode
it seems to be default to use Automatic Reference Counting [ARC] - So I fixed the
errors, changed deprecated references to supported ones and changed it to use ARC.
Also storyboards are have now a better support. I renamed CustomButton class to UICustomButton. I also remove common.h and common.m and added functions from there to be included in UICustomButton class. I removed some non-necessary code and simplified it
a bit.

Guide:
Include files Classes/UICustomButton.h and Classes/UICustomButton.m in your project.
To use UICustomButton from Storyboard, set button type to custom, class to UICustomButton
and then set background and textcolor of your choice. When program is executed, button
is rendered. It won't render in storyboard view.
